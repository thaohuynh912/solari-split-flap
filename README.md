# Solari Split-Flap Display

A physically accurate split-flap (Solari board) display built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No dependencies.

## Features

- **Physically correct drum mechanics** — each cell has a single drum that only spins forward, cycling through every intermediate character in sequence (space → A–Z → 0–9 → punctuation), just like real Solari hardware
- **Deceleration** — flaps spin fast at the start and slow down as they settle on the target character
- **Synthesized click sound** — Web Audio API generates a short filtered-noise burst per flip (no audio files needed). Activates on first user interaction
- **Author names in yellow** — lines prefixed with `@` render in gold, right-aligned
- **Cascading stagger** — cells flip left-to-right, top-to-bottom with a 50ms delay per cell
- **Responsive** — scales down on tablet and mobile
- **Zero dependencies** — single HTML file, no build step

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it.

### Customization

Edit the `quotes` array in the `<script>` block. Each quote is an array of lines:

```javascript
var quotes = [
  ['FIRST LINE',
   'SECOND LINE',
   '',
   '@AUTHOR NAME'],   // @ prefix = yellow, right-aligned

  ['ANOTHER QUOTE',
   '',
   '@SOMEONE'],
];
```

#### Configuration variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COLS` | 20 | Number of columns (characters per row) |
| `ROWS` | 8 | Number of rows |
| `FLIP_MS` | 150 | Single flap animation duration (ms) |
| `CHAR_DELAY` | 50 | Stagger between cells in cascade (ms) |
| `HOLD_MS` | 5000 | Time to hold a finished quote before cycling (ms) |

### Embedding

Drop the HTML into any page. The display is a self-contained `<div>` with scoped styles and an IIFE script — no global pollution.

## How it works

Each cell contains four layers:
1. **Top half** — static, shows the current character's upper portion
2. **Bottom half** — static, shows the next character's lower portion
3. **Flip front** — animated flap showing the old character (flips down)
4. **Flip back** — backside of the flap showing the new character (revealed as flap lands)

The flip uses CSS `rotateX(-180deg)` with `transform-origin: bottom center` and `backface-visibility: hidden` for a realistic 3D fold.

The drum sequence is fixed: `' ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.,:;!?\'-'`. To go from any character to any other, the drum advances forward through every intermediate position — wrapping around if needed. This matches how mechanical split-flap displays physically operate.
